#If yes, notify user and ask for next letter
#If not, notify user.

#If user has not exhausted the available tries, ask for the next letter.

#If tries are exhausted, notify user that theyâ€™ve lost. Reveal secret and exit.

#Make sure that your code never goes into an infinite loop, and always manages to exit gracefully (ie without throwing an error)

#Always notify the user about the correct letters/wrong letters, remaining tries.
