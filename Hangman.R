#'Prepare a dictionary of words to choose from and save it in a txt file (one column) and save it in the project directory
# Created Dictionary.txt fils with names of animals/birds from A-Z

#'Read the word list from your program.
#'convert it to matrix so each word is indexable
list <- as.matrix(read.table("/Users/mausamvk/Assignment_3/Dictionary"))

#Choose a random element from the list. 
random_word <- sample(list, 1)

#Inform the user on the length of the secret word. Hint: You may test nchar()
function(word) {
  print(paste("The length of the secret word is",nchar(random_word)))
}

#Inform the user about the number of wrong guesses/tries allowed. You decide on the rule here and implement it. Please comment your code appropriately.


#Ask for user input. The user is expected to enter one character only, check for this.
#Optional; check if the character is a letter
#Optional: make sure that both lower and upper case letters are acceptable and treated as equivalent


#Check to see if the user input is in the secret word.
#If yes, notify user and ask for next letter
#If not, notify user.

#If user has not exhausted the available tries, ask for the next letter.

#If tries are exhausted, notify user that theyâ€™ve lost. Reveal secret and exit.

#Make sure that your code never goes into an infinite loop, and always manages to exit gracefully (ie without throwing an error)

#Always notify the user about the correct letters/wrong letters, remaining tries.
